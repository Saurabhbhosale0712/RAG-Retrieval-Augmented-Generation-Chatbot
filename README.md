# RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Chatbot

#Intelligent Chatbot with RAG-Based Contextual Understanding**  
 
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered chatbot** that enhances user interaction by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The chatbot integrates **Flask API, Faiss for vector search, MySQL for chat history storage, and Sentence Transformers for embedding-based retrieval**. It provides intelligent responses by analyzing user queries and fetching the most relevant data from a pre-indexed database.

### **Project Objectives**  
1. **Develop a Context-Aware Chatbot**  
   - Implement an AI chatbot that understands user queries and retrieves meaningful responses using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.  

2. **Efficient Information Retrieval with Faiss**  
   - Use **Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** to store and retrieve top-k relevant text chunks based on semantic similarity.  

3. **Integrate a Scalable Database (MySQL)**  
   - Store user interactions in a **MySQL database** for conversation history tracking and future analysis.  

4. **Deploy a Web-Based Chat API using Flask**  
   - Create a RESTful **Flask API** that allows users to send queries and receive intelligent responses in real-time.  

5. **Enhance Model Performance with Sentence Transformers**  
   - Utilize the **"all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model** from **Sentence Transformers** to generate query embeddings for fast and accurate retrieval.  

6. **Enable Real-Time Accessibility with Ngrok**  
   - Use **Ngrok** to expose the chatbot API for remote access and testing, allowing seamless deployment in cloud-based environments.
